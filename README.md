# Serious Engine 1 Symbol Differences

This is a collection of lists with exported library symbols from different versions of Serious Engine 1 and individual games.

Each game/engine version is its own commit and every change leading up to the release of a specific game is under its own branch, the main one being [`serious-sam`](https://github.com/DreamyCecil/SE1-LibrarySymbolDifferences/tree/serious-sam), from where each other game branches off.

Visit [**this repository**](https://github.com/DreamyCecil/SE1-StaticLibrariesForGames) to grab static libraries themselves for all of the games and engine versions. These symbol lists come with them.
